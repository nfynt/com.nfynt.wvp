### Unity Web Video Player

A video player plugin for Unity WebGL applications. Unity's builtin VideoPlayer generally doesn't work for WebGL or is not supported on mobile browsers. This package uses Web-native video elements to read the video source and exposes the basic video controls to Unity.
You can use video URLs either from `StreamingAssets` path or external web servers (permissing CORS). Video controls include - Start, Stop, Pause, Resume, (Un)Mute, and respective events within the editor. This package supports in-editor playing as well using Unity's VideoPlayer.
